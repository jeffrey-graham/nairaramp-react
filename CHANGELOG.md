## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-08

### Added
- **`usePayWithNaira` hook**: Complete ramp lifecycle management with 6 distinct phases (`idle`, `starting`, `awaiting_user`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`), automatic watcher subscription and cleanup on unmount/reset, double-start protection, and error normalization as `NairaRampError`.
- **`PayWithNaira` component**: Drop-in payment button that opens the anchor flow synchronously via `window.open` before awaiting deposit response, handles popup blockers with a fallback `"Continue to the anchor"` link, enforces WCAG visible focus outlines, provides polite screen reader announcements (`aria-live="polite"`), and adapts to 360px mobile viewports.
- **`StatusTimeline` component**: Progress timeline displaying the 6 sequential steps (`Started`, `Waiting for your payment`, `Payment received`, `Anchor processing`, `Sending on Stellar`, `Completed`) with `aria-current="step"` on the active step, complete compile-time coverage for all 15 `TransactionStatus` values via `STATUS_MAP`, dedicated failure notifications (`role="alert"`), and custom translation support via `labels` prop.
- **Next.js App Router compatibility**: Configured `tsup` build banner to prepend `"use client";` to line 1 of all ESM and CJS bundles.
- **Packaging & CI**: Dual ESM (`dist/index.js`) and CommonJS (`dist/index.cjs`) builds with TypeScript declarations (`dist/index.d.ts`), comprehensive test coverage across 28 unit tests, and multi-version Node (20 & 22) CI pipeline.

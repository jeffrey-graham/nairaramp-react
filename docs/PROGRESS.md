## 2026-11-08 - Step 06: usePayWithNaira hook

- **What was built:**
  - `src/usePayWithNaira.ts`: Implemented `usePayWithNaira({ ramp, assetCode })` returning `{ start, phase, status, transactionId, url, error, reset }`. Supported phases: `idle`, `starting`, `awaiting_user`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`. Managed lifecycle transitions, watcher unmount cleanup, reset handler, double-start guard, and wrapped errors as `NairaRampError`.
  - `src/index.ts`: Exported `usePayWithNaira` and types `UsePayWithNairaOptions`, `UsePayWithNairaResult`, and `PayWithNairaPhase`.
  - `test/usePayWithNaira.test.tsx`: Added comprehensive unit test suite covering full successful deposit and status lifecycle (`idle` -> `starting` -> `awaiting_user` -> `processing` -> `completed`), watcher unmount cleanup, watcher reset cleanup, double-start prevention, immediate deposit failure, watcher onError failure, terminal status failure, and unmounted state update protection.
- **Commands run with results:**
  - `pnpm build`: Built ESM, CJS, and DTS bundles cleanly via `tsup` (exit code 0).
  - `pnpm lint`: Ran `eslint .`, passed with 0 errors (exit code 0).
  - `pnpm typecheck`: Ran `tsc --noEmit`, passed with 0 errors (exit code 0).
  - `pnpm test`: Ran Vitest suite with `jsdom`, 2 files and 12 tests passed (exit code 0).
- **Open issues:** None.

## 2026-11-08 - Step 07: PayWithNaira component

- **What was built:**
  - `src/PayWithNaira.tsx`: Implemented `<PayWithNaira ramp assetCode amount? onComplete? onError? label? />`. Synchronously opens `window.open("", "nairaramp_anchor")` before start, updates href when url arrives, closes popup on failure, renders blocked-popup fallback link (`"Continue to the anchor"`) if window.open returns null, renders phases (`idle`, `starting`, `awaiting_user`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed` with "Try again" reset), fires `onComplete` and `onError` once each when reached, formatted with inline styles (width 100%, maxWidth 420px, readable at 360px), type="button" buttons with visible focus, and `aria-live="polite"` status region.
  - `src/index.ts`: Exported `PayWithNaira` and `type PayWithNairaProps`.
  - `test/PayWithNaira.test.tsx`: Added 9 unit tests verifying synchronous `window.open` call before start resolves, blocked-popup fallback link attributes, all UI phases, error recovery via Try again button, single execution of `onComplete` and `onError` callbacks, popup closure on start or watcher failure, and aria-live/responsive styling constraints.
- **Commands run with results:**
  - `pnpm build`: Built ESM, CJS, and DTS bundles cleanly via `tsup` (exit code 0).
  - `pnpm lint`: Ran `eslint .`, passed with 0 errors (exit code 0).
  - `pnpm typecheck`: Ran `tsc --noEmit`, passed with 0 errors (exit code 0).
  - `pnpm test`: Ran Vitest suite with `jsdom`, 3 files and 21 tests passed (exit code 0).
  - Investigated GitHub Actions CI failure:
    1. `pnpm/action-setup@v4` threw due to redundant `version: 9` conflicting with `packageManager: pnpm@9.15.9` in `package.json`. Removed redundant `version` key so action reads `packageManager` directly.
    2. Vitest on Linux Node ESM environment threw `SyntaxError: Named export 'PublicKeypair' not found` when importing `@stellar/typescript-wallet-sdk` via `@nairaramp/core`. Configured `server.deps.inline: ["@nairaramp/core", "@stellar/typescript-wallet-sdk"]` in `vitest.config.ts`.
    3. Confirmed GitHub Actions run `42499981892` passed 100% green on both Node 20 and Node 22 matrices.
- **Open issues:** None.

## 2026-11-08 - Step 08: StatusTimeline component

- **What was built:**
  - `src/StatusTimeline.tsx`: Implemented `<StatusTimeline status={TransactionStatus | undefined} message?={string} labels?={...} />`. Configured 6 ordered steps (`Started`, `Waiting for your payment`, `Payment received`, `Anchor processing`, `Sending on Stellar`, `Completed`), typed `Record<TransactionStatus, StatusMapping>` ensuring full compiler status coverage, `<ol>` markup with `aria-current="step"` on the active step, completed step indicator checkmarks, pending step indicators, plain failure line plus anchor message for failure statuses (`refunded`, `expired`, `no_market`, `too_small`, `too_large`, `error`), optional `labels` prop for translation, and responsive inline styles.
  - `src/index.ts`: Exported `StatusTimeline`, `type StatusTimelineProps`, `type TimelineStep`, `type StatusMapping`, `type StepStatusMapping`, `type FailureStatusMapping`, `TIMELINE_STEPS`, and `STATUS_MAP`.
  - `test/StatusTimeline.test.tsx`: Added 7 test suites validating all 15 `TransactionStatus` enum values in a loop (checking label display, timeline structure, and `aria-current="step"` on active item), undefined status fallback to Started, custom label translations, failure message rendering with `role="alert"`, in-progress message rendering, and exported step array ordering.
- **Commands run with results:**
  - `pnpm build`: Built ESM, CJS, and DTS bundles cleanly via `tsup` (exit code 0).
  - `pnpm lint`: Ran `eslint .`, passed with 0 errors (exit code 0).
  - `pnpm typecheck`: Ran `tsc --noEmit`, passed with 0 errors (exit code 0).
  - `pnpm test`: Ran Vitest suite with `jsdom`, 4 files and 28 tests passed (exit code 0).
- **Open issues:** None.
